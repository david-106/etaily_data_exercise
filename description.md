TASK# 3 Table Design

I will design the table by, first dividing each weather reports from Philippines depending on the city, it can also be divided based on Region(Region 1, Region 2, etc.), it can also be divided based on major island(Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao). After that we can categories the weather report based on timestamp, group weather reports from 00:00 - 11:59 and 12:00 to 23:59.



TASK#4 Data Pipeline Design in Cloud Setup

The possible approach I can think of is using gps to detect the country, by using GPS, it will be automated based on their position. The possible consideration that would affect my choices is wether the end user wish to use the current location or choose another location to get the weather data.
